# Objectives
1. Create an Employee node that will take 2 params - a String and an int. The String value will populate the name property of the new Employee node, the int value will populate the emp_id value. 

2. Return all Employee nodes to a client. 

3. Check your code into a github repo along with instructions on how to set up/use the API. 

4. include instructions on how to use it in the README.md file in the github repo. 

5. Develop a simple UI that can be used directly from the web browser to drive the API.

6. Deploy your app along with a Neo4J instance to an AWS EC2 instance  (or any other cloud) so that we can see it in action without going through the setup process.
